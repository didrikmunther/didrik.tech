# Generact - A generative React component approach

For the February European Builders' League hackathon in Stockholm, I had the opportunity to work on a project of my choice for 48 hours. During the 48 hours, David St√•lmarck, Leonid Meledin, Ivan Wely and I built a proof of concept preprocessor for React, exposing the `<Generate>` tag:

```jsx
<Generate>
  a product view of my {products}
  when pressing the "Add to cart", run {onAdd}
</Generate>
```

With static analysis, we can infer the type of `product` and `onAdd` to provide more intelligent code generation. A VSCode extension provides the "Generate" and "Patch" code lenses for each Generate element, allowing for quick prototyping.

  <video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-3">

    Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Future work

For a future extension of this proof of concept, I'd like to see it be possible to add arbitrary SQL statements to be executed, e.g.:

```jsx
<Generate>
  when pressing the "Add to cart", execute {sql`INSERT INTO ...`}
</Generate>
```
